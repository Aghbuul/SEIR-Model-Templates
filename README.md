# SEIR Model Templates
This repository contains templates for various SEIR models (including SEIRS, SCIR, and Vax Event models) for epidemiological simulations. I uploaded this because I don't know how to use Git and I'm trying to practise.
I'm used to just making copies and appending v1,2,3,etc. like a luddite.

If you have any questions about why I did what I did, feel free to ask. Though, I made these a year ago so chances are I wouldn't know either.
